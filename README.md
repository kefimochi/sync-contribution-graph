## How to Use ðŸš€

1. [Create a new repo](https://github.com/new) and [clone it](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) on your local machine.

   > **Note:** You can't simply fork this repository because none of the commits will count toward the contribution graph.
   > [More info here](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-contribution-graphs-on-your-profile/why-are-my-contributions-not-showing-up-on-my-profile#issues-pull-requests-and-discussions).

2. Clone this project locally and copy/paste it's contents into the repo you just created.
3. Run `npm i` in your terminal.
4. Use `run start` in order to trigger a series of terminal prompts that will help with configuration.
   > On Windows, please run it from Git Bash.

If you change your mind about these commits later, you can delete the repository and they'll disappear from your contribution graph.

## Requested Information ðŸŒ³

| Key        | Description                                                                                                                                                 | Default value                                        |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `username` | The username whose graph contributions you'd like to copy.                                                                                                  |                                                      |
| `year`     | Year that you would like to sync with provided `username`. Currently doesn't support multiple years.                                                        | Current year                                         |
| `execute`  | Let's the code know whether to simply generate `script.sh` that, when executed, will force push commits to `main`. Or to both generate and execute at once. | `false`, in other words generate _without_ execution |
| `confirm`  | A quick double check that you're ready to proceed.                                                                                                          |

## How do I know this is secure? ðŸ”’

Explore the [code](src/index.js)! It's tiny and there aren't many dependencies.

It only scrapes publicly available data from existing GitHub contribution graphs. It does not have access to private commits or issues created. So I can promise that you will not get in trouble for syncing your personal and work GitHub graphs considering there isn't any private company code being exposed!

## Using with Github Enterprise

You'll need to set a few environmental variables

```
export GITHUB_DOMAIN=git.{YOURDOMAIN}.com
export GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN={a personal access token with the correct permissions to read users}
export GITHUB_COOKIE={a cookie copied from an active browser session (this should work with pretty much all SSO implementations}
npm run start
```

## On Project's Future âœ¨

There's a lot of potential features and automations that could be added! Something as basic as accepting multiple years to pull at once, or more complicated like having a GitHub Action that once per month/year/time period creates a PR with newer commits, making it effortless to keep them synced.

## Contribute ðŸ‘ª

PRs are welcome! One day I'll probably write a Contributing guide. This project is [MIT](LICENSE) licensed.
